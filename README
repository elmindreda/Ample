Note that I'm aiming for API completeness first, so most lookups are still O(n)
or worse and thus it should scale very poorly.  The API is designed to allow
for more efficient algorithms, however.

Please do complain anyway, however.  Feedback is always welcome.

Also note that the geometry node only supports 64-bit real layers and the
object node only 64-bit transforms.  This will probably change, one day.
