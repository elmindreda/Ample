If you are on a Unix operating system and you just checked this out from CVS,
you will want to run bootstrap.sh to get a configure script.

Otherwise, you will probably want to make a Visual Studio project file.  I
don't provide one just yet.

I know that the internals aren't very OO yet, but I've begun work on correcting
that.

Note that I'm aiming for API completeness first, so most lookups are still O(n)
or worse and thus it should scale very poorly.  The API is designed to allow
for more efficient algorithms, however.

Please do complain anyway, however.  Feedback is always welcome.

Also note that the geometry node only supports 64-bit real layers and the
object node only 64-bit transforms.  This will probably change, one day.
