Simple C++ retained mode library for verse.

I know that the internals aren't very OO yet. I wanted to let the API settle before I did that.

Before you complain about implementation details, remember that I'm aiming for API completeness first. Please do complain, however.

Also, I know that the code isn't even slightly optimised. It will be, after  the design has settled.

Note that the geometry node only supports 64-bit real layers for now.
