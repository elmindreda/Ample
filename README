If you're on a Unix operating system and you just checked this out from CVS, you'll want to run bootstrap.sh to get a configure script. Otherwise, you'll probably want to make a Visual Studio project file. I don't provide one just yet.

I know that the internals aren't very OO yet, but I've begun work on correcting that.

Before you complain about implementation details, especially concerning performance issues, note that I'm aiming for API completeness first, so most lookups are still O(n) or worse.

Please do complain anyway, however. Feedback is always welcome.

Also note that the geometry node only supports 64-bit real layers for now.
