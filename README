Simple C++ retained mode library for verse.

If you're on a Unix operating system and you just checked this out from CVS, you'll want to run bootstrap.sh to get a configure script. Otherwise, you'll probably want to make a Visual Studio project file. I don't provide one just yet.

I know that the internals aren't very OO yet, but I've begun work on correcting that.

Before you complain about implementation details, know that I'm aiming for API completeness first. Please do complain anyway, however. Feedback is always welcome.

Also, I know that the code isn't even slightly optimised. It will be, after the design has settled.

Note that the geometry node only supports 64-bit real layers for now.
